# A colorhunt.co website scraper
Nodejs scrapper that scrapes all palettes data from [colorhunt.co](https://colorhunt.co/).

Willing to clone it someday ðŸ˜‰.

## Usage

Install the dependencies using `pnpm` or the one of your choice:

```bash
pnpm i
```

Running the script:

```bash
pnpm fire
```

Wait until the script is finished, you will then find a JSON file containing the data saved as `data/colorhunt.json`.
